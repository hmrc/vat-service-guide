# Penalties and appeals
<!--- Section owner: MTD Programme --->

The way that HMRC levies VAT penalties and interest charges has changed. The changes apply to everyone who submits VAT returns for accounting periods that start on or after 1 January 2023. Penalties for late submission and late payment are considered to be fairer, and will be more consistent across taxes when the reform is extended to other tax regimes in the future.

Businesses that do not submit VAT returns on time will receive penalty points. When the number of penalty points reaches a threshold, HMRC will levy a penalty charge.

Additionally, HMRC will charge late payment interest from the day that a VAT payment is overdue to the day that payment is made in full.

You can find information about the rules and thresholds that relate to late submission and payment penalties on GOV.UK:

## Appeals
<!--- Section owner: MTD Programme --->

The [existing process for appeals](https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals/penalty) will remain in place, although a provision will be made to allow the user to appeal their penalties through the digital tax account.

A business or agent may contact HMRC if they have a query about a tax decision. If they donâ€™t understand the decision they can also get advice from HMRC or professional help.
