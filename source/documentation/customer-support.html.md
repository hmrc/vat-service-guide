# Customer support model
<!--- Section owner: MTD Programme --->

The customer support model guides HMRC customers to the most appropriate support. This may be provided by HMRC or the software vendor depending on the issue.

The support offering for VAT (MTD) customers includes guidance on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-online-services-helpdesk), webchat, support links on all HMRC online pages, and support over the phone.

We will provide additional support material here as we continue to develop the service.
